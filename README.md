Here are my experiments/works in Processing. Its sorted by date, 01-arrow is the first thing I did in Processing, and XX-XXXXX is the latest so far ;)

01 - Arrows
-----------
First project. Arrows are supposed to follow the cursor of the mouse. 

[You can see a demo here.](http://monsieurdoc.github.com/processing-ex/01-arrows.html)

02 - Network
------------
A bunch of circle generated randomly, linked together randomly. On hover, it increases the size. On click it changes the color.
